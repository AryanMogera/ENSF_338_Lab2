1. I would use a binary search since the rooms are sorted. The binary search would divide the array of rooms in half, if the key matches the middle item the search ends. if the key is < middle item it divides the left subarray in half repeats from beginning or if key is > middle item it divides the right subarray in half and repeats until a match is found.
